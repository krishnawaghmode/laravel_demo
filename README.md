<h2 style="color:cyan">Project Installation</h2>

   In the XAMPP directory, there exists a folder called “htdocs”. This is where all the programs for the web pages will be stored.

Now, to run a PHP script:

Go to “C:\xampp\htdocs” and inside it, create a folder. Let’s call it “demo”. It’s considered good practice to create a new folder for every project you work on.
Clone the Project: 
```bash
     git clone https://github.com/krishnawaghmode/laravel_demo.git
     cd laravel_demo
     composer install
     cp .env.example .env

     Set up .env file

     php artisan key:generate

     http://localhost/project/laravel_demo
 ```
